# Property Prediction Using AutoML - Pycaret


Pycaret is an Automatic Machine Learning Framework which automatically compares different base models and returns all of their performance metrics.
This eventually saves so much time in choosing which model would perform to the given dataset. These models can also be fine tuned for performance 
improvements. For more information about pycaret, visit : https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/ 


Here, AutoML is used to predict the properties/target of a property model dataset. Few of the other techniques which are not implemented in notebook are 
presented like cluster method, scaffold split etc. The same process can be used for any stuctured datasets. 

Pycaret includes many useful automatic functions like auto encoding, feature selection, removing collinearity etc., All of these can be explored but the 
results should be compared with standard modules for validations.
